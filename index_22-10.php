			<h2>Love your Cricket?<br />Would you like to help out at the "Grass Roots"?</h2>

			<p>The Adelaide Uni Cricket Club is currently looking for scorers for their Grade Cricket teams.</p>

			<p>Uni Cricket Club has four SACA teams who play on our beautiful home grounds in the Adelaide parklands (a cricket ball's throw from Adelaide Oval).</p>

			<p>A small payment is provided for each day scored. This might be a great opportunity for an interested school or Uni student to earn some cash.</p>

			<p>If you know (or think you can learn) how to score and are interested in contributing to a Grade Cricket Club in Adelaide please contact David Penn (M. 0439 490 010 or E. david.penn (AT) sa.gov.au).</p>

Our 'Cricket Club' is special. We have members who played cricket as juniors or seniors, those who watch it all year round, others who follow it come summer, and some who just listening to it on the radio...the one thing in common for all is that we love our cricket.</p>



<p>It's a good wicket because Cricket Lovers (SA) aim is to promote the game of cricket. We have been doing this with The Australian Cricket Society for more than 34 years and <a href="awards.php">support Young Cricket Talent</a> through our <a href="events.php">Member Events</a>.</p>
